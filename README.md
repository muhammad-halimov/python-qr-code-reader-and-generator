Hi there !

App is written in Russian, those who don't understand it sorry... but you can use google translate or modify app to translate it.

I'm considering you are looking for some app or project that can read & generate qr-codes, so you found it !

The project uses EEL, qrcode & opencv-python libraryes for UI and to read & generate qr-codes.

If you don't installed this libraryes before, you can just unarchive the venv folder, it contains virtual environment for python and also libaryes, that i mentioned before.

If you want to see the result, you should copy file that you want to convert to the project catalog beside qr.py (it uses the relative paths), when you start the project choose file that you copied !

After a few moment apears a window that tells you that reading or generating is done !

The result of reading will appears in the bottom.

Some links and comands:
https://www.python.org/downloads/ - download python

venv\Scripts\activate - open cmd and put this comand, ones you unarchive venv.zip (you should unarchive it where it's stays, don't move it somewhere)
python qr.py - to start the project (put it after putting venv\Scripts\activate), once you done you tasks, put deactivate on cmd to deactivate venv
